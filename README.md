# Form Validation Exercise
In this exercise you will be making the following form:

![Form](./images/Screen%20Shot%202022-05-26%20at%2011.04.02%20PM.png "Form Validation")

The first 2 data fields: First Name and Last Name have been created with working validation. Your job is to finish creating the entire form to match the image above and to provide data validation. For example, for the Social Security Number field the user should be able to provide the SSN in any one of the following formats: 123-45-6789 or 123.56.6789 or 123-45-6789. If correctly provided, the "helper text" shown below each input field should turn green and should turn red otherwise.
